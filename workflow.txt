# PM 2.5 invades the blood supply and PM 10 can only reach uptil the lungs 
Approach 1 : 
- Use of diffraction angle to compute the the PM 
 
Doubts ? 
1. Can we use phone cameras to analyse or do we have to use vision sensors to analyse
2. What approach are we to use to - Diffraction 

Work Deployment  
- Sensor data 
- Computer Vision 
Method of Interpolation
